            <h3><a href="https://werewolf.chat/Seer">Seer information</a></h3>
            <p><b>Features:</b> The seer can verify the identity of a person as a good person or a werewolf at night.</p>
            <p>The seer is an important village team role in Werewolf that appears in the majority of games played. Seers perform their action at night, using see <nick> to determine the role of any other player. The seer's visions are not flawless, as they see cursed villagers as wolves, and other wolfchat roles such as hags and traitors as villagers. Seers are a primary target for the wolves, so they must be careful not to reveal their information too explicitly, instead indirectly aiding the village by backing other safes. Special wolf team roles can especially hinder the seer's ability to lead. The werecrow is one such role that can pinpoint likely seers through their observations. At higher player counts, the wolf team gains a sorcerer, who is able to detect seers during the night phase and relay that information immediately. Seers cannot naturally have the cursed villager template.</p>
            <br/><b>Recommendation:</b> Weresolves seer</p>

          <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_witch_trials">Witch information</a></h3>
          <p><b>Features:</b>The witch has a one potion and one posion</p>
          <p>This role, while first and foremost taking on all the elements of a regular Villager throughout the game, also has the additional powers of one potion and one poison, which they may use at any point throughout the game. When the Witch is added, the Moderator will wake them up separately during the night with, “The Witch comes awake…” and follows this with “The Witch brings someone back to life.” and “The Witch poisons someone.” The Witch will then point to the person they want to poison or bring back to life. While the Witch can only use their potion and poison once, each action must be said each night to retain anonymity as to what has been done. They can only use one per evening until both are gone, and have the ability to save them until a point in the game they deem fit.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://werewolf.chat/Hunter">Hunter information</a></h3>
          <p><b>Features:</b>If hunter be killed, It can kill any people</p>
          <p>You are a hunter. Once per game, you may kill another player with kill <nick>. If you do not wish to kill anyone tonight, use pass instead.
Once per game at night, the hunter may kill someone by using kill <nick> in PM. They may choose not to kill anyone during a particular night by using pass in PM instead. It is generally not recommended for the hunter to use their power on the first night of the game, as they may accidentally kill an important role such as the seer. By waiting for information during the daytime, they can make a more informed decision on a subsequent night.</p>
          <p><b>Recommendation:</b> Agua Fresca</p>
